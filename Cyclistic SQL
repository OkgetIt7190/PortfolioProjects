To be able to look at all the data in one place we need to combine it so it can be one cohesive piece
in order to do that I used union to combine. I also filtered out the nulls using the Where clause.


-------Combining all 12 datasets into one and calling it 'cyclistic.annual'-------
select * into [cyclistic.annual]
( 
	select * from [2205]
	union
	select * from ['202206-bd$']
	union
	select * from ['202207-divvy-tripdata$']
	union
	select * from ['202208-divvy-tripdata$']
	union
	select * from ['202209-divvy-publictripdata$']
	union
	select * from ['202210-divvy-tripdata$']
	union 
	select * from ['202211-divvy-tripdata$']
	union
	select * from ['202212-divvy-tripdata$']
	union 
	select * from ['202301-divvy-tripdata$']
	union 
	select * from ['202302-divvy-tripdata$']
	union
	select * from ['202303-divvy-tripdata$']
	union
	select * from ['202304-divvy-tripdata$']
) AS [CyclisticAnnual]
where [start_station_name] is not null
	and [start_station_id] is not null
	and [end_station_name] is not null
	and [end_station_id] is not null
;

select * 
from [cyclistic.annual];


-----------change month format to show name
	ALTER TABLE [cyclistic.annual]
ADD month_name VARCHAR(20);

UPDATE dbo.[cyclistic.annual]
SET	[month_name] = FORMAT(started_at, 'MMMM')

------------CHANGE WEEKDAY FORMAT TO SHOW NAME--

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[cyclistic.annual]
ADD weekday_name VARCHAR(20);

UPDATE [dbo].[cyclistic.annual]
set[weekday_name] = DATENAME(WEEKDAY, day_of_week);

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[cyclistic.annual]
DROP COLUMN day_of_week;

select * 
from [cyclistic.annual]


--alter ride_length column to show only length of ride instead of date and time--

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[cyclistic.annual]
ADD ride_length_time TIME;

UPDATE [dbo].[cyclistic.annual]
SET ride_length_time = CONVERT(TIME, ride_length);

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[cyclistic.annual]
DROP COLUMN ride_length;

select * 
from [dbo].[cyclistic.annual]
